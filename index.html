				<h2>Studentcooking</h2>

				<div class="description">
					Since I'm really into cooking I wanted to share my passion. As a student, I don't have a big kitchen, all
					the tools or a big budget. So my plan is to share that it's possible anyway, to cook a wide variety 
					of simple and healthy meals for yourself. It's not even as hard as many might think.
					So I created an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hft_studentcooking" title="hft_studentcooking instagram">Instagram</a> where I post the meals as soon as
					they are cooked. In addition to that I set up a hugo blog on <a href="/studentcooking" title="my studentcooking blog">hisfantor.com/studentcooking</a>
					, where you can find some of the "recipees" I have cooked. I keep the instructions as minimal as possible since I believe that you learn the most by trying yourself.

			<h2>Blog</h2>
			<div class="description">
				Another playground for my web design hobby is <a href="http://hisfantor.com/blog/" title="hisfantor.com/blog">my blog</a>, where I try new stuff and test ideas. It is the same
				as studentcooking a static site generator, but this time run by jekyll. But other than the web design aspect I try to collect 
				useful information there. I wrote some guides or just general write-ups of things that I have worked on regarding Linus, Keyboards
				and so on. My idea is, if I have figured out something, then the next person doesn't have to do it, if I document the process well.
				In addition to my own posts I started integrating guest posts about the same topics. 
				Since it's pretty easy to write markdown it could help to share some useful information in my opinion.

				<h2>lowercase_games</h2>
				<div class="description">
					Between 2016 and 2018 I worked on a couple of games with the lowercase_games team which I co-created. 
					I was responsible for game design, Linux versions and organisation within the team and our social media channels.
					We made all our games for game jams, which was a great experience since we had a given theme for the game and a limited time (which was 72h for the last 3 games).
					<h3><a href="https://lowercase-games.itch.io/metamorph" title="Metamorph game page/download">Metamorph:</a></h3>
					This retro looking game which is played on a command line might look simple, but has a trick to it.
					It's a boss monster marathon where the boss evolves based on the methods you killed him last time,
					which makes him basically unkillable a few levels in.
					<h3><a href="https://lowercase-games.itch.io/im-no-shut-in" title="im-no-shut-in game page/download">I'm no shut-in:</a></h3>
					Here we have a story based point and click adventure which can be finished in about 15min.
					It tells a compelling tale of a young man and his room. Also our famous mascot the flamingo
					will be introduced for the first time.
					<h3><a href="https://lowercase-games.itch.io/dipsomaniac" title="dipsomaniac game page/download">Dipsomaniac:</a></h3>
					A side-scroller that simulates being drunk, telling a fun story. The gameplay gets harder the more
					you drink, but the end... well you'll see
					<h3><a href="https://lowercase-games.itch.io/rose-coloured-dungeon-life" title="rose-coloured-dungeon-life game page/download">Rose-Coloured Dungeon Life:</a></h3>
					This dungeon full of mythical monsters is not the easiest to master. You'll encounter 4 different monsters
					which are so lovely that you might fall for them and fight off the humans. Depending on your answers, you can 
					achieve a variety of different endings.

				<h2>Lists and Tables</h2>
				<div class="description">	
					One of my strange quirks that I'm really into is making lists, but not like a shopping list like normal 
					people. I like to visualize or combine information for projects that I am working on, general things 
					I'm interested in and especially for buying decisions. 
					Most of the time are these lists not useful for anyone else then myself,
					but I enjoy making and maybe someone else might get some use out of them.

				<h2>Mechanical Keyboards</h2>
				<div class="description">
				On the 24.8.2016 started my journey down the rabbit hole which is r/MechanicalKeyboard.
				I posted a layout idea of an 40% layout with additional numpad. If you follow <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/4zdnpk/an_idea_of_a_40_board_with_numpad/" title="reddit post about my first keyboard design">this comment thread</a>
				you'll witness how a reddit user in the states was so intrigued by my design that within hours of my post he laser cut 
				the plate and case and built up a prototype which arrived a few weeks later at my home and became my first mk. <br> 
				The second one I built was the famous planck which I outfitted with a USB hub so I can add a mouse dongle and a micro SD card
				to plug it all in my phone. After r/place in 2017 I created an homage to the blue corner which got much love from the community.
				Since I was so in love with these small keyboards I created a roundup of the most common 40% layouts, which has been
				used for keycap reference. I'm still working on keyboards, writing up information and building new boards as I go.

			<div class="description">
				Now this is a somewhat strange thing to write about in my portfolio since reddit is "just a website". 
				But in the past 5 years of using reddit I got introduced to so many new things, new hobbies and people and such a great part of the internet.
				I fell in love with the old school internet like design, which makes the entry for newcomers that little more complicated, so the nerds can stay within their realms.
				There is so much to love about reddit, the posts aren't about the people, it's about the content and as soon as
				you adjust your front page you get a feed of all the stuff you love. But if you are there for the people, if you 
				are seeking the interaction you surely can and I had nothing than great experiences in the comments and DMs. <br>
				discussins about keyboard layouts, programming and some quirky Linux features. <br>
				To be honest, I just got into Linux because I fell in love with the beauty of r/unixporn. <br>
				r/DataHorder got me into RAID and NAS-solutions which led to my now giant mountain of movies(rip r/megalinks). <br>
				Subreddits about the current tv shows which provide all the memes. <br>
				Inspiration in all fields from art to diy and some of my favorite things to look at knives, watches and of course mechanical keyboards. <br>
				I get great trades on the mechmarket or secret santa.<br>
				I moderate some subreddits myself and play around with the custom css. <br> 
				I even made it to the front page once with the gif I created of the battle bots trophy. <br>
				At last I want to mention the companion cube which I built on r/place which was one of the greatest internet experiences for me.
